    steps:
    # Step 1: Checkout the code from the repository
    - name: Checkout code

    # Step 4: Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile
    # Tags the image using the username and "youtube-echo:latest" as the tag
    - name: Build the Docker image
      run: |
        docker build -t ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/youtube-echo:latest .

    # Step 5: Push the Docker image to Docker Hub (or other registry)
