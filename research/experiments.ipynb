    "### Information about the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The code provides a streamlined framework for interacting with YouTube videos and their transcripts using a combination of various libraries and services. It includes functionality to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fetch YouTube Transcripts: Using the YoutubeLoader from the langchain_community library, the code retrieves transcripts from YouTube videos in chunks for detailed analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Search for YouTube Videos: The scrapetube library is employed to search for videos based on user-defined criteria such as relevance, upload date, view count, or rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Generate Document Embeddings: The OpenAIEmbeddings class from the langchain_openai library is used to create embeddings for the transcript documents, which are essential for semantic understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create and Utilize Vectorstores: The FAISS library is used to index the document embeddings and facilitate efficient retrieval of relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Ask AI Questions: The ChatGroq model from langchain_groq handles the question-answering process, providing responses based on the context derived from video transcripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Display Video and Results: Functions are included to display video content and transcripts, and to present search results and AI-generated responses in a user-friendly manner.\n"
